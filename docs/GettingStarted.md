First, select the development environment that you will be playing the game in. We highly recommend you play with *Microclimate*, which is our new container-based microservice-oriented development environment. 

You may also play using a programmer's text editor (such as VS Code or Atom), or using Eclipse and the IBM Liberty Development Tools.

### A) Install the development environment of your choice.
- **Recommended**: [Developing Rogue Cloud using the Microclimate Beta](Developing-Microclimate.md)
- [Developing Rogue Cloud using a Text Editor (Sublime, VSCode) and Maven](Developing-Text-Editor.md)
- [Developing Rogue Cloud using Eclipse and IBM Liberty Developer Tools](Developing-LibertyDevTools.md)

### B) [Edit the agent code and watch it explore the game world from your browser.](Developing-CodingNextSteps.md)
